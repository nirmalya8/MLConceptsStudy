# Curve Fitting
Polynomial Curve fitting has been conducted. We have used a synthetically prepared a dataset based on the sine function. To create a dataset, say for a data point x, we have used y(x) = sin(x) + Some random number between 0 to 1. These x and y values will form the dataset we want to fit the polynomial curve on. As we can see that the actul function will be a bit different from sin x, as suggested by the plot we did.
