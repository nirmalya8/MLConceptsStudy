# Curve Fitting
Polynomial Curve fitting has been conducted. We have used a synthetically prepared a dataset based on the sine function, adding some random noise to each datapoint. So, the actual function will be a bit different from sin x.
We fitted a curve of degree 3 based on the mean squared loss function using the Gradient Descent Optimizer. The CurveFitting.ipynb notebook is pretty self explanatory with all the math equations and code.
